# KICT-FYP-LaTeX-Class

A LaTeX document class for KICT's (IIUM) FYP report.

# Dependencies

- LuaLaTeX (The report requires the use of the Arial font)

# Usage

1. Compile frontmatter using `compile.sh` found in the frontmatter folder. This only needs to be done once unless you make changes to frontmatter variables.
2. Compile the report using `make` (I haven't created this yet).
